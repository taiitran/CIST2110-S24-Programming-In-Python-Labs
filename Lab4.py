# 1. Write some code that asks the user for a number and prints out whether it is positive, negative, or zero.


# 2. Write some code that asks the user for a number and prints out whether it is even or odd.


# 3. Write some code that asks the user for a number and prints out all the numbers from 1 to that number using a while loop.

# 4. Use a for loop to ask a user for 5 numbers and print out the average of those 5 numbers.

# 5. Write some code that prints out all the numbers from 1 to 10 that are divisible by 3 or 5.

# 6. Write some code that asks the user for a number and then prints out a countdown from that number to 1 using a while loop. After the countdown, print "Blast off!".

# 7. Write some code that asks the user for a number and then uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to that number. If the current number is divisible by 7, print "Lucky" and continue to the next iteration. If the current number is greater than 100, break the loop.
