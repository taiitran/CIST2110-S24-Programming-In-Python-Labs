This lab is designed to get you familiar with Python input(), converting data types, and using the round() function.
"""

# 1. Ask the user for their name and assign it to a variable called "name".

# 2. Ask the user for their age and assign it to a variable called "age".

# 3. Ask the user for a balance and assign it to a variable called "balance".

# 4. Ask the user for a number of years to calculate interest and assign it to a variable called "years".

# 5. Ask the user for an interest rate and assign it to a variable called "interest_rate".

# 6. Convert the balance, years, and interest_rate to float data types.
# Note: This is only necessary if you did not specify the data type in the input() function.

# 7. Calculate the future balance using the formula: balance * (1 + interest_rate/100) ** years

# 8. Round the future balance to 2 decimal places using the round() function.

# 9. Print the following sentence using string concatenation: "Hello <name>, your balance after <years> years will be $<future_balance>."
